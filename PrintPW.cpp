// "Physics and "Wallah", can be printed in two different lines, by using the 'endl' operator or '\n' operator.
// An illustration is shown via the following code : 

/*#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main (){
    cout<<"Physics";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Wallah";
}*/

// The above code can be written in a single line as well: 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main (){
    cout<<"Physics"<<endl<<"Wallah";
}
